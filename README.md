# Frogger

## Overview

This is my first project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a grid-based game to be rendered in the browser, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was to be completed **individually** within **one week**.

Given a list of options from GA, I chose to re-create the classic game **Frogger**. Please note that while the game is designed in terms of roombas and cats, this documentation is written in terms of the original Pac-Man lingo, e.g. referring to _ghosts_ and _energizers_, as the underlying code also uses this jargon. 

You can launch the game on GitHub pages [here](https://lucymait.github.io/project-1/)

## How to play

Use ← ↑ → ↓ arrow keys to move the player
Avoid enemies
Collect plenty gems to achieve a high score!
Win by jumping on the water

## Brief

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Design logic for winning & visually display scoreboard**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
